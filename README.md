# Life-Expectancy-Insights-Challenge

## ðŸ“‹ Overview
Welcome to the **Life Expectancy Insights** competition! Your task is to predict the life expectancy of individuals based on various health, demographic, and socio-economic factors. This challenge provides an opportunity to explore real-world datasets and apply your data science and machine learning skills to uncover patterns that influence life expectancy.

## ðŸ“– Description
Understanding life expectancy is a critical step in addressing global health and socio-economic challenges. By analyzing patterns and relationships in data, we can gain insights that inform policy, healthcare strategies, and social initiatives.

### What is Life Expectancy?
Life expectancy refers to the average number of years a person is expected to live based on current mortality rates. It is influenced by a wide range of factors, including:

- **Health conditions**: Immunization coverage, prevalence of diseases, and access to healthcare.
- **Demographic features**: Age, gender, and population metrics.
- **Socio-economic conditions**: Education levels, income, and living standards.

Accurately predicting life expectancy helps governments, organizations, and researchers identify areas of intervention and allocate resources effectively.

## ðŸ§® Evaluation
Submissions for this competition will be evaluated based on the **RÂ² (Coefficient of Determination)** metric. This metric assesses how well your model's predictions align with the actual values. 

- **RÂ² value closer to 1**: Indicates a better fit, meaning your model explains most of the variance in the data.
